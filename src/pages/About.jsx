        As a young boy I had dreams and aspirations of traveling. As I got older
        I realized traveling was not cheap, thats where coding comes into play.
        I want to travel while being able to work and doing coding seemed like
        the easiest way to do so. My goal in this field is to be able to grow my
        portfolio all while continuing to see parts of the globe I have never
        seen. <br />
        A few personal things about me, I love people. I love meeting new people
        and having conversations to learn new things. I have two animals, a dog
        and a cat. Koba bean is my pup and he is a Mini Australian Shepherd.
        Slim Kipperson is my kitten. In my free time you can find me studying
        going to the beach, at the gym or having a few drinks with friends.
